    <P>
    I was born in California, and grew up in Honolulu, HI.  I joined the <br>
    Army when I was 17 as an interrogator and after training was stationed <br>
    at Ft Bragg, NC.  I moved back to Hawaii when I was medically retired <br>
    and worked at Sacred Hearts Academy as their IT Manager.  I taught at <br>
    the US Army Interrogator school in Ft Huachuca, AZ before taking a <br>
    contract in Iraq.  I worked as a software testing consultant for <br>
    several years before moving to Toronto, Canada where I live now.<br><br>
